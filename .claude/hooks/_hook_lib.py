"""Shared helpers for VoidClip C++ quality hooks (PostToolUse).

Each hook receives the tool payload as JSON on stdin and decides whether to act on the
edited file. These helpers centralise payload parsing, path scoping, and tool execution so
the individual hooks stay tiny and consistent. This is the C++ counterpart of the reference
Python engine's ``_hook_lib.py``: it drives clang-format / clang-tidy instead of ruff / ty.
